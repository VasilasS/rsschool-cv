## Present to myself:

Hello, I'm a bachelor student of the IBSU and I'm looking for new opportunities.
My IT experience started as a child. I have been following this interest for an earlier period. I was interested in software and gaming, which encouraged me to learn English and, therefore, enriched my IT vocabulary. In addition, there were various school activities and projects, and YouTube tutorials on multiple topics. Then I enrolled in an information technology program at the International Black Sea University. I have been interested in web development for more than three years, and because of this, I continue actively studying and working by myself.
I have assembled different types of websites with html5, css3, Javascript, and WIX. Also, I passed several courses and obtained certificates.

### My Goal!

As a _Junior Developer,_ my primary goal is to immerse myself in a collaborative environment where I can apply my programming skills and continually enhance them. I aspire to be part of a team that values creativity encourages continuous learning.

### What is important to Me:

What matters most to me is writing code and crafting solutions that solve real-world problems. Collaboration and creativity are values I hold dear, and I am eager to contribute these qualities to any team.

**In summary**, I want not just to be a Developer, I want an enthusiastic learner, a problem solver, and a team player ready to contribute to the exciting development world.
